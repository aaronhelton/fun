nouns.txt is a plain text list of English language nouns, one per line, pulled from a list of collective nouns and the animals/people/things they refer to.  Use the list however you like.  Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_collective_nouns_in_English

adjectives.txt is a plain text list of simple English language adjectives, one per line.  Once again, use it how you like.
